# Linear Regression Analysis of Temperature Trends in India

Welcome to the Linear Regression Analysis of Temperature Trends in India project repository. This project focuses on applying linear regression to analyze historical temperature data in India, explore trends, and build a predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains temperature records for India, with data available up to the year 2017. Temperature values are recorded in degrees Celsius, representing the average temperatures from various locations in India. The data is sourced directly from the Indian government website, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have applied linear regression to the temperature data to achieve the following key objectives:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was cleaned, and any missing values were handled to ensure that it's ready for analysis.

2. **Linear Regression Model:** We implemented a linear regression model to understand how temperature changes in India have been influenced by various factors and to make forecasts for future temperature trends.

3. **Model Evaluation:** We evaluated the performance of our linear regression model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Squared (R²) score.

## Project Results

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.1274
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.2468
- R-Squared (R²) Score: 0.6672

These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of our model's performance, indicating its accuracy and explanatory power.
